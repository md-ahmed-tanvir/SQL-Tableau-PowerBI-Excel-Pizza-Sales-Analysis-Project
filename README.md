**Data**

Pizza Sales Data 2015 (downloaded from kaggle.com)

**Problem Statement**

The objective is to thoroughly examine crucial indicators within the pizza sales dataset to extract valuable insights into business performance. This analysis necessitates the creation of comprehensive data visualizations to provide a clear understanding of various facets of the pizza sales data, facilitating the identification and comprehension of key trends in business operations.

**Analysis:**

Key indicators for pizza sales data were analyzed to gain insights into business performance. Specifically, the following metrics:

Total Revenue: The sum of the total price of all pizza orders was calculated.

• Sales by Category & Size: Demand was evaluated.

• Average Order Value: The average amount spent per order was calculated by dividing the total revenue by the total number of orders.

• Total Pizzas Sold: The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold was determined.

• Total Orders: The total number of orders placed was counted.

• Average Pizzas Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order was calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.

Various aspects of pizza sales data were visualized to gain insights and understand key trends. The following requirements were identified for creating charts:

• Daily Trend for Total Orders: a bar chart was created to display the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart was designed to help identify patterns or fluctuations in daily order volumes.

• Monthly/Hourly/Weekly Trend for Total Orders: a line chart was crafted to illustrate the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart was used to identify peak hours or periods of high-order activity.

• Best & Worst Sellers: Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: a pie chart was generated to display sales distribution across different pizza categories. Insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales were provided by this chart.

**Project Phases**
